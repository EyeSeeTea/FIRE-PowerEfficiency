1. Introduction
---------------
This example demonstrates simple messaging communication between two LoRa 
shields fitted to Arduino UNO, Mega, or similar boards. One LoRa shield acts
as a server, responding to requests from the other shield acting as a client.

The example is useful for doing simple surveys of a link as it does a 
request/response every few seconds, flashing an LED on the server and displaying
the payload and signal strength using the serial port on both devices.

There are two Arduino sketches - one for the server (rf95_server.ino) and 
the other (rf95_client.ino) for the client.

The sketches use the RadioHead library Driver class RH_RF95 (rf95)

Driver classes are provided in the library for a range of radio devices.
The RH_RF95 library works with Semtech SX1276/77/78/79 and similar LoRa capable
radios. It supports Long Range (LoRa) with spread spectrum frequency hopping,
large payloads etc.

The RH_RF95 Driver class does not provide for addressing or reliability, 
so it is useful if you do not need the higher level messaging capabilities. 
These additional capabilities are available in the Manager classes if required:

2. Setup
--------
The example code is designed to run on Arduino boards such as the UNO, Mega or 
similar, fitted with a LoRa shield such as the Dragino device:

Communication between the Arduino and LoRa chip utilises the SPI bus.

The Arduino serial port outputs messages showing the startup process and 
the details of individual requests/responses. This can be monitored using the
Serial Monitor in the Tools menu of the Arduino IDE.

For a simple test, use two Arduino boards fitted with LoRa Shields, and load
the rf95_client.ino software on to one device, and the rf95_server software 
on to the other device using the Arduino IDE (tested on Ver 1.6.8).

There is no special board configuration required for the Client device.

On the Server device, an LED and resistor may be connected between the designated 
I/O Pin (defined by "LEDPIN" - Pin 7 by default) and GND. The software will 
light the LED to indicate the request/response operation.

Ensure that the correct Board and Serial Port are selected (Tools/Board and 
Tools/Port), then start the Serial Monitor (Tools/Serial Monitor). Messages 
will be displayed in the monitor window showing the operation of the software.

3. Operating Parameters
-----------------------
At the top of each .ino file there are a number of parameter definitions that 
determine the operation of the device. The parameters for both devices need to 
be set to the same values to allow them to communicate with each other.

3.1 Modem Configuration
--- -------------------
Three modes are defined in the rf95 library as follows:

  // Bw = 125 kHz, Cr = 4/5, Sf = 128chips/symbol, CRC on. Default medium range
  #define MODE1 rf95.Bw125Cr45Sf128 
  // Bw = 500 kHz, Cr = 4/5, Sf = 128chips/symbol, CRC on. Fast+short range
  #define MODE2 rf95.Bw500Cr45Sf128); 
  // Bw = 31.25 kHz, Cr = 4/8, Sf = 512chips/symbol, CRC on. Slow+long range
  #define MODE3 (rf95.Bw31_25Cr48Sf512);

Set the required mode in this line:
  #define MODE       MODE1   // Set modem configuration - Mode 1, 2 or 3.

3.2 Frequency
-------------
Set the required frequency in this line:
  #define FREQUENCY  915.0   // Frequency in MHz

Ensure that the frequency is within the operating range of the particular LoRa
device that you have (e.g 915, 868, or 433 MHz) 
Typical devices will operate +/- 1MHz satisfactorily.

3.3 Tx Power
------------
Set the required transmit power in this line:
  #define TXPOWER    23      // Set to 5 - 23 dBm

It is usual to set the same power level for both devices so that they receive
the same signal level across the link.

4. Software Operation
---------------------

4.1 setup()
-----------
In each file there is a setup() function that does the following:

 - Initialise the serial port
 - Initialise the LoRa chip
 - Set the operating parameters for the LoRa chip

4.2 Client loop() 
-----------------
The loop() function on the client device sends a request to the server.
The request payload is simply the string "Request from Client".

It Then waits for a response, up to the Timeout period (e.g. 3000mSec).

If a response is received then the response payload is output on the serial 
port for display in the Serial Monitor window.

If no response is received, then a warning message is output.

After receiving a response, the client waits for a period (e.g. 2000msec)
before sending the next request.

4.3 Server loop()
-----------------
The loop() function on the server device checks to see the LoRa chip is available, 
and then checks to see if a request has been received. 
If so, the LED is switched ON.

The payload of the request is then output to the serial port for display in the 
Serial Monitor window, along with the received signal strength (RSSI).

A response is then sent, with a payload consisting of the string 
"Response from server".

After a short period (e.g 200mSec) the LED is switched OFF.

In operation, the LED will flash each time a request is received, and the Serial
Monitor will display the request payload string and the signal strength.
