1. Introduction
---------------
This example demonstrates the operation of the Real Time Clock module based 
on the Maxim DS3231 chip. It is adapted from the Tronix Labs tutorial in Ref[1]

The sketch (RTC-Test1.ino) allows you to set the time and data on the RTC module and display 
the data in the Serial Monitor. It is designed to run on an Arduino UNO, MEGA 
or similar board.

The RTC module communicates with the Arduino board using the I2C bus.

As well as the "RTC-Test1.ino" file, there is a second file "functions.h" 
which contains the code for all the functions for reading and writing data
to the RTC chip via the I2C bus, and for displaying the data via the Serial
port.

2. Setup
--------
Connect the RTC module to the Arduino board using the GND, 3.3V (VCC), SDA and
SCL pins. 

On the Arduino Uno or compatible boards, these pins are A4 and A5 for 
SDA (data) and SCL (clock).

On the Arduino Mega board the pins are D20 and D21 for SDA (data) and 
SCL (clock).

The Arduino serial port outputs messages showing the progress of the setup and
data output. This can be monitored using the Serial Monitor in the Tools menu 
of the Arduino IDE.

Before loading the sketch to the Arduino board, edit the definitions at the top
of the sketch to enable the data setting functions as required, as well as the
data for the times and date. 

3. Operating Parameters
-----------------------
At the top of the sketch code there are a series of definitions for controlling
the operation of the data setting operations. Set these definitions to "true" 
"false" to enable/disable the individual operations.

Next is a set of definitions for the data to be used in the time/date setting
operations. Set these definitions to the required values.

4. Software Operation
---------------------

4.1 setup()
-----------
The setup() function first initialises the I2C bus and Serial port.

It then calls the various functions to write data to the RTC module via 
the I2C bus if these have been enabled in the definitions.

Finally it calls functions to read data from the RTC module and displays this 
data as time and date via the Serial port, which can be viewed using the 
Serial Monitor facility in the Arduino IDE Tools menu.

4.2 loop()
----------
The loop() function is not used for any purpose in this sketch.

4.3 functions.h
---------------
This file contains the code for the data "set", "get" and "display" functions.
